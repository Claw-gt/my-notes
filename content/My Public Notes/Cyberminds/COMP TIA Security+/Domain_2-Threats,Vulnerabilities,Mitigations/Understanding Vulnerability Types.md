## Impact

Vulnerabilities impact:
- **Confidentiality**: data breaches and data exfiltration (removal of sensitive information from an organization's control)
- **Integrity**
- **Availability**

We group risks to our organiztions into several different categories:
- *Financial risk*: involve monetary loss to the organization
- *Reputational risk*: impacts how stakeholders view our organization
- *Strategic risk*: jeopardizes our ability to meet our major goals and objectives
- *Operational risk*: affects our ability to carry out day-to-day activities
- *Compliance risk*: involves potential violations or laws or regulations

## Supply chain vulnerabilities

- Security issues may arise in the supply chain
- Running products that lack vendor support introduces significant security risks (patch management is crucial)

- *End of sale (EOS)*: product will no longer be offered for purchase, but the vendor will support existing customers
- *End of support (EOS)*: vendor will reduce or eliminate support for existing users of the product
- *End of life (EOL)*: vendor will no longer provide any support or updates for the product

Vendor may fail to provide adequate suport for existing products
Vendir may not disclose the use of embedded systems (clients depends on vendor)
Mitigate risks associated with data storage and other vendor dependencies

Consider multiple sources of risks:
- Hardware providers
- Software providers (Client-based and Agentless)
- Managed Service Providers (MSPs)

## Configuration vulnerabilities

Have a significant impact on security.
- **Default configurations** may contain misconfigured firewalls, unnecessarily open permissions, guest accounts, default passwords, or unsecured root accounts => follow documented security standards and baselines when configuring systems and applications
- **Cryptographic Vulnerabilities**.
	Weak cipher suites
	Weak cryptographic protocol implementations
	Poor key management
	Poor certificate management

âš  Important:
=> *Patch Management* ensures to correct the known vulnerabilities (patch OS, firmaware, and application)
=> *Account Management* prevents accidental or intentional misuse by carefully managing permissions assigned to accounts
=> *Principle of Least Privilege*

## Architectural vulnerabilities

**IT Architecture**: processes and practices used to design systems
=> Incorporate security early. Avoid bolt-on security requirements
Untrained users and weak businesses processes can be just as dangerous as technical flaws

**System Sprawl**: new devices are connected to a network, but old devices are not promptly disconnected, leading to security vulnerabilities. *Even riskier when assets are undocumented*

=> Avoid using legacy hardware and firmware components
