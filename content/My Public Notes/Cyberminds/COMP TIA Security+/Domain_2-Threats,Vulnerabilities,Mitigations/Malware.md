## Virus, Worm, and Trojan Horse

**Propagation Mechanism**
The way that a malware object spreads
###### see [[2. Host Security#^b9a657|Malware types]] and [[Cyberminds Academy/Week 1/Introduction to Cybersecurity Tools & Cyber Attacks/Module 2/Malware and Ransomware/Malware|Malware]]

- *Viruses* (human interaction)
- *Worms* (by themselves)
- *Trojan Horses* (apparent trusted software)

**Payload**
Malicious action that the malware perform

- *Spyware*: gathers information without the user's knowledge or consent
	Logging keystrokes
	Monitoring web browsing
	Searching hard drives and cloud storage
	Note: Bloatware (adware and sypware) is slipped onto a system by other software installers
- *Ransomware*: blocks access to data by encrypting it
e.g. WannaCry in 2017: exploited EternalBlue Windows vulnerability that demanded Bitcoin ransom
LockBit ransomware continues to infect systems today
	
- *Crypto-malware*: Steals computing capacity of a user's system to mine cryptocurrency


#### Preventing Malware
- Anti-malware software
- Security patched
- User education

## Backdoords and Logic Bombs
Some malware embed itself in others

- *Backdoor*: provides workaround access
	Hardcoded accounts
	Defalt passwords
	Unknow access channels
- *Logic Bomb*: delivers a triggered payload
	Date/Time reached
	File contents
	API call results

## Rootkits and Fileless viruses
The Root Account is a special superuser account that provides unrestricted access to a system resources
- *Rootkit*: escalate user privileges. **Can run either on user mode or kernel mode**
	**Payloads**: Backdoors, Botnet agents, adware/spyware, anti-theft mechanism
	*User mode rootkits*: run with normal user privileges. Are easy to write and difficult to detect
	*Kernel mode rootkits*: run with system privileges. Difficult to write and easy to detect

- *Fileless Viruses*: remain in memory. They do not write files to disk
	They can mantain persistence by writing a copy of themselves to the Windows Registry (load them back after reboot)

## Botnets
Steal computing power, network bandwidth, and storage capacity
=> Network of infected machines
Malware Target: added to botnet once infected
**Objectives:**
- Renting out computing power
- Delivering spam
- Engaging in DDoS attacks
- Mining Bitcoin
- Waging brute force attacks
*Botnet Command and Control*: 
- Command and control network relay orders
- Communication must be indirect and redundant
- Internet Relay Chat (IRC)
- Twitter
- Peer to Peer within the botnet

## Malicious Script Execution
A script is a sequence of instructions written in a programming language to automate our work

- **Shell Scripts**: Run at the command line and integrate with the operating system
*Bash*: scripting language used on Linux and Mac systems
*PowerShell*: scripting capabilities for Windows systems

- **Application Scripts**: Run within a software application and integrate with that application
*Macros*: scripts that run in application environment
*Visual Basic for Applications (VBA)*: macro scripting language used with Microsoft Office

- **Programming Languages**: Allow the creation of general purpose code
*Python*: general purpose programming
