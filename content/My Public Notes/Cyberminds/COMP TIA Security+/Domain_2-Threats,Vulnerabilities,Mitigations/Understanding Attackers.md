## Attack vectors
Provide an attack path

- Emails (phising)
- SMS, Messages
- Voice calls
- Social media
- Flash drives
- USB cables
- Card skimmers
- Cloud services
- Physical access to network
- IT supply chain (insert backdoors)
- Wireless networks

## Zero-day attacks
Patches protect against many cybersecurity vulnerabilities
But, Undiscovered security vulnerabilities lurk in existing code

#### Ethical Disclosure
1. Notify the vendor of the vulnerability
2. Provide the vendor a reasonable amount of time to create a patch
3. Disclose the vulnerability publicly

If remained silent:
#### Zero-day Vulnerbility
A vulnerability in a product that has beem discovered by at least one researcher but has not yet been patched by the vendor.
There is not patch for it

##### Window of Vulnerability
Time between teh discovery of a zero-day vulnerability and the release of a security update

=> **Advance Persistent Threats (APTs)** are well-funded and highly skilled, typically government sponsored, have access to zero days and other sophisticated weapons and work methodically to gain access to a target.
âš  Defending againt APTs is difficult but not impossible:
- Build a strong security foundations
- Implement strong encryption
- Use rigorous monitoring
