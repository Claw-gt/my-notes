Monitor and control **industrial processes**

### ICS Deployments
- Building automation systems
- Workflow automation systems
- Process automation systems

=> **ICSs ARE hacker targets**
- Dramatic implications
- Systems not well secured
- No current patches

### ICS Types

#### Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)
- Remote monitoring
- Remote telemetry (remote sensors)
- Sensors report back to control systems
- Multiple points of attack (sensors, central...)
-

#### Distributed Control Systems (DCSs)
- Focueses on controlling processes
- Sensors and feedback systems
- Multiple points of attacks

#### Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs)
- Handles specialized input and output
- Ensures uninterupted processing
- Connect to HMI
- Used in SCADA and DCS
##### Modbus Protocol
Allow simple communication through Serial interface communication
