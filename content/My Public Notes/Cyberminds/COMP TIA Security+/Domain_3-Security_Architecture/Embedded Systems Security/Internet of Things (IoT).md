IoT is everywhere. Smart devices are computer controlled and netwrok connected

**Begins with wireless network connectivity**

# Security challenges

- Dificult to update and underlying OS
- Connect to home and office wireless networks
- Connect back to cloud services
- Collect real sensitive information

---
## Securing smart devices

**Check for weak passwords**
**Update**
- Automatic Updates
- Manual Updates
**Firmware Version Control**: updates applied in orderly fashion
**Security Wrappers**
	Alternative to patches. Device is not accessible through the network but it is instead reached through a wrapper system that monitors input and output for security issues
	Mini FW for embedded devices

>[!important] Use DIVERSE and REDUNDANT security controls to protect embedded devices

Protect smart devices by placing them on a secure network environment
## Secure networking for smart devices

**Network segmentation**
Place a firewall between personal/home network and Embedded Device Network. Same concept as DMZ
=> *The most important security measure* ⚠

**Application firewalls**
Provide added protection
Monitor inbound traffic (buffer overflows, XSS...)
*Embedded device security controls are effective to old mainframes too* ⚠
