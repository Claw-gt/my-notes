Organizations minimize risk by removing identifying information from datasets
### Deidentification
Removes obvious identifiers
=> not enough
#### Identifying Individuals

- ZIP + DOB (*Day of Birth*) + Gender
=> 87% unique

### Anonymization
Removes the possibility of identification

Follow HIPAA De-Identification Standard
- **Expert Determination** approach: Apply statistical scientific principles. Very small risk that anticipated recipient could identify individual
- **Safe Harbor** approach: Removal of 18 types of identifiers. No actual knowledge of residual information can identify individual

### Data minimization
Reduces risk very effectively
