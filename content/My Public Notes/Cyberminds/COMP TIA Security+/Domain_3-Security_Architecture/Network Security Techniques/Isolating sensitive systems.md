# Network Segmentation
Separates systems of differing security levels

Particularly sensitive servers may be placed in tehir own physically isolated security zone:
**Physically** isolation systems => *air-gapped* systems

# Jump Server
Allows administrative connections between zones. Monitor isolated zones
a.k.a *jump hosts, jump boxes*

Faciliate jumping to other security zones
They provide isolation and monitoring. They limit the entry points to critical systems => reduces the attack surface

=> must be carefully secured since they can bypass firewalls
