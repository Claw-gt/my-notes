**Perimeter Security**

=> Keep unwanted **remote users** out of the network entirely through the use of **firewalls** and other controls
Usual vendors: Palo Alto, Cisco and Checkpoint
The assumption is that the internal netwrok is trusted, and the external networks are untrusted.

**Network Access Control (NAC)**

=> Limit **physical network access** to authorized individuals and devices, both for internal and external users
