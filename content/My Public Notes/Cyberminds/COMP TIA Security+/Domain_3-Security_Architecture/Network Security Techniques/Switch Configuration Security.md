Protect **physical security** of switch
Unlike routers that centrally located in secure data centers or netwrok rooms, switches are spread all over the place

âš  An attacker who gains physical access to your switch controls that portion of the network

**VLAN Security**: Disable automatic trunk negotiation to prevent VLAN hopping attacks
\**VLAN trunking*: technology that switches use to carry VLANs accross many switches
## VLAN Pruning
Implement **Least Privilege Rule**: only trunk VLAN if that VLAN is needes on that switch
Limit unnecessary exposure of VLANs by limiting the number of switches where they are trunked, especially for sensitive VLANs

## VLAN Trunk Negotiation
VLAN hoping attack by pretending to be a switch
**Deny automatic VLAN trunk negotiation** to limit the effectiveness of VLAN hopping attacks

## Port Security
Limit the devices that may connect to a network switchport by MAC address (avoid connection of rogue devices)
Effective against MAC flooding

- **Static Port Security**
Administrator *manually* configure valid MAC addresses for each port
- more secure

- **Dynamic Port Security**
Switches memorize the first MAC address they see on each port and limit access to that address
- faster but more risky
## DHCP Snooping
Block malicious DHCP traffic
