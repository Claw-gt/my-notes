### Security Is A Design Element

"Bolt-on" security rarely works => it must be integrated from the start (much less expensive)

## 1. Fail Open
- Failed security controls are bypassed. *If they fail, they are automatically bypassed*
- Favors continued business operations
- May pose an unacceptable security risk
normally for IDS
## 2. Fail Closed
- Failed security controls block access
normally for Firewalls
