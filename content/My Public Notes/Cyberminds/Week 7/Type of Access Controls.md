Discretionary Access Control (DAC) and Mandatory Access Control (MAC) are two different access control models, and they differ from Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in the following ways:

1. *Discretionary Access Control (DAC):*
    - In DAC, the owner of an object (e.g., a file or resource) has the discretion to determine who can access that object and what permissions they have.
    - The owner can explicitly grant or deny access to individual users or groups.
    - DAC is based on the identity of the user and the permissions associated with that user.
    - DAC is the traditional access control model used in many operating systems, including Windows.
2. *Mandatory Access Control (MAC):*
    - In MAC, access control decisions are made based on a set of predefined security labels or clearances.
    - The system administrator defines the security labels and the access rules, and users cannot override these rules.
    - Access is granted or denied based on the comparison of the subject's security label (e.g., user's clearance) and the object's security label (e.g., file's classification).
    - MAC is commonly used in highly secure environments, such as military or government systems, where security is of the utmost importance.
3. *Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):*
    - RBAC is a more advanced access control model that focuses on the roles and responsibilities of users within an organization.
    - In RBAC, permissions are assigned to roles, and users are then assigned to those roles.
    - This allows for more efficient and scalable management of access rights, as changes to permissions can be made at the role level rather than the individual user level.
    - RBAC provides a more structured and organized approach to access control, making it easier to implement and maintain.

The key differences between these models are:

- DAC is based on the identity of the user and the permissions associated with that user, while MAC is based on predefined security labels and clearances.
- RBAC is a more advanced model that focuses on the roles and responsibilities of users, rather than individual identities or security labels.
- RBAC provides more flexibility and scalability compared to DAC and MAC, as it allows for centralized management of permissions and access rights.

In summary, DAC is the traditional access control model, MAC is used in highly secure environments, and RBAC is a more advanced and efficient model that is widely used in modern computing environments, including Windows.
