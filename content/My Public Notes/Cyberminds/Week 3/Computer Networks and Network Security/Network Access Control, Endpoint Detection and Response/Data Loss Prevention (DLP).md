--> Classify data by sensitivity and importance
--> Identify and tag sensitive information
--> Create policies for handling sensitive data
--> Execute policies
--> Define data access and conditions

**Host-Based DLP**
Uses software agents installed on a single system
**Network-Based DLP**
Scans network transmissions for sensitive information
**Cloud-Based DLP**
Operate as managed security services

*Pattern Matching*: recognized known patterns of sensitive information, such as SSNs
*Watermarking*: Indentifies sensitive information using electronic tags

##### Tools: Spirion
### Implementation steps

1. Identify sensitive data types and potential risks
2. Integrate tools into existing network infrastructure
3. Ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and global standards
4. Raise awarenees among employees
5. Detect and analyze security threat
6. Creat threat response

### Threat Response

--> Detect data leakage incidents
--> Develop incident response procedures
--> Isolate affected systems
--> Conduct investigations
--> Implement corrective actions
