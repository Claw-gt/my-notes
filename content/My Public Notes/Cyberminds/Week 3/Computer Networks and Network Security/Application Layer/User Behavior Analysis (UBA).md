--> Adds an extra layer of security
--> Focuses on internal activities
--> Detects suspicious behaviour early
--> Mitigates threats proactively

#### Baselining normal behavior

- Establish normal behavior patterns
- Monitor typical activities
- Flag deviations

#### Anomaly detection

- Identifies deviations from the baseline
- Detects potential threats
- Triggers alerts

#### Contextual awareness

- Analyzing user roles and activities
- Consider activity context
- Accurately interpret behavior

### Techniques and tools

#### Machine learning algorithms
- Learning and updating behavior patterns
- Enhancing anomaly detection accuracy
- Predicting potential threats based on historical data

#### Statistical analysis
- Quantify deviations from normal bahavior
- Techniques: 
	- **Standard deviation**
	- **Correlation analysis**
	- **Regression models**

#### Log analysis
- Analyze access logs, application logs, network logs
- Aggregating and correlating data to identify patterns and anomalies
