Cloud deployment models describe the cloud environment types that organizations might use.

> [!important]
> No cloud model is **inherently** superior to the other approaches. It all depends on the context

## Private Cloud

Organization uses a dedicated cloud infrastructure
--> Do not share resources with others

## Public Cloud

Organization uses a **[[Multitenant computing|multitenancy]]** infrastructure
- Uses a **shared responsibility model** (**SRM**): the cloud provider is responsible for some areas of security whil the customer is responsible for other areas
e.g. *Customer is responsible for assigning permission rights and the data that is send to the cloud*
*Cloud Provider is responsible for the encryption of the data that is sent*
## Hybrid Cloud

Organization uses both private and public cloud
Depends on the workload
## Community  Cloud

Shared with a consortium
Similar to private cloud, since they are not open to general public

## Multicloud

Combines resources from two different public cloud vendors
