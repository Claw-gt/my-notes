# Multitenancy

Shared computing resources

# Isolation

User don't impact each other
A customer should never be able to see data from other customer. 
--> **Core security tasks**

# Oversubscription at Work

Sold capacity exceeds actual capacity
Customers will never use all that capacity **simultaneously**

# Resource Pooling

CPU and memory shared among users
Can be reassigned as needed

> [!important]
> When isolation breaks down, performance suffers
> Key task of Cloud Service Providers
