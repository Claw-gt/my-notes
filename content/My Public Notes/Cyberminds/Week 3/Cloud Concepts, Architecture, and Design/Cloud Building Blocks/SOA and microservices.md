# Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)

Design philosophy that embraces the use of discrete services that may be accessed by customers in a black-box fashion

### Service Characteristics
- Logical representations of a repeatable business activity with a specified outcome
- Self-contained
- May be composed of other services
- Black-box nature (*user don't need to know how the service works, just what it does and how to access it*)

--> Service-oriented architectures facilitate the integration of services from different vendors


# Microservices

Fine-grained services
- Adopted on Function as a Service environments
- Allow independent execution of code on  acloud platform
