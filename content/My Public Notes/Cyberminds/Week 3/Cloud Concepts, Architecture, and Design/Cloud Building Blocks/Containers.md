Lightweight application virtualization

--> **Virtual machines run on top of a hypervisor**
- Heavy
- Each one has to have OS and components

--> **Containers are a lightweight alternative to virtual servers**
- Contain application code and dependencies only
- Run on containerization platforms, instead that on a hypervisor
- Use the host's operating system. **They do not have their own OS**
