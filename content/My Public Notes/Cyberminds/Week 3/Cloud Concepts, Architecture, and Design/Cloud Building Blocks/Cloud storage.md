Storage is a fundamental building block of cloud computing

# Block Storage

^dec8c8

Allocates a large chunk of storage for access as a disk volume managed by the operating system
- Block Storage must be allocated and paid for in drive-sized blocks (even if nothing is stored on it)

### Types

- Magnetic: slower but cheaper
- Solid state: faster but more expensive
# Object Storage

^887270

Stores files as individual objects managed by the cloud service provider
- Much less expensive than block storage in the cloud
- Object storage costs are incurred only when used

### Types

- High availability: instant availability of your files but more expensive
- Archival: cheaper but it may take several hours to restore your files for active use



> [!important]
> Most enterprise computing environments have a need for both block and object storage

# **Cloud Storage Security**

- Set permissions properly
- Make use of encryption for sensitive data
- Replicate data to multiple data centers
