# Cloud infrastructure and components

Virtualized servers run in cloud data centers

#### Cloud Computing Options
- Serverles computing
- Containers
- Platform as a service (PaaS)
- Software as a service (SaaS)

[[Cloud storage#^dec8c8|Block Storage]] and [[Cloud storage#^887270|Object storage]]

#### Management Plane
Dedicated network for insfrastructure administration

# Cloud data centers

Every cloud service depends upon physical resources

#### Acquisition Options
- Build your own data center
- Purchase an exisiting data center
- Lease space in someone else's data center

#### Multivendor Connectivity
Using differrent physical paths
Reduces likelihood of network disruption

#### Tenant Partitioning
Separates cloud customers

# Data center tiers

Data centers have very different levels of resiliency

#### Data Center Tiers
Describe the level of resiliency of facilities

##### Tier 1 Data Centers
*Most basic*
- Uninterruptible power supply (UPS)
- Dedicated cooling equipment
- Generator for extended outages
- 99.671% availability

##### Tier 2 Data Centers
- Redundant cooling components
- Redundant power components
- Fuel storage
- 99.741% availability

##### Tier 3 Data Centers
- Never require maintenance shutdowns
- 99.982% availability

##### Tier 4 Data Centers
*Most sophisticated*
- Protected against unplanned events
- 99.995% availability

# Site and Facility Design

#### 1. Data centers
Access control
#### 2. Media storage facilities
Evidence storage locations must preserve chain of custody
#### 3. Wiring closets

# Data center environmental controls

Data centers contain sensitive electronic environment
#### Air temperature
Cooling requirements friendly to electronics --> Consumes electricity
##### Expanded envelope
Between 64.4ºF and 80.6ºF
####  High humidity
Leads to condensation that may damage electronic equipment
#### Low humidity
Leads to static electricity that may damage electronic equipment
##### Dew Point Range
Between 41.9ºF and 50.0ºF

--> HVAC systems keep temperature and humidity under control

*Servers draw cool air in the front and expel hot air out the back*
--> The **hot aisle/cold aisle approach** makes cooling data centers more efficient

# Data center environmental protection

Environmental disasters put data centers at risk

#### Fire detection and suppression

##### Solutions for fire suppression
- Water eliminates the heat factor but **damages electronic equipment**
- Fire extinguishers

| Type of extinguisher | Description                                  |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Class A              | Common combustibles (wood, cloth, and trash) |
| Class B              | Flammable liquids (gasoline and oil)         |
| Class C              | Electrical fires (data centers)              |
| Class D              | Heavy metal fires (industrial applications)  |
| Class K              | Kitchen fires (fats and oils)                |
- Building-wide suppression systems (often use water)
	Wet Pipe: contain water in the pipes ready to deploy when a fire strikes
	Dry Pipe: do not contain water until a valve opens during a fire alarm
- Chemical systems deprives fires of oxygen

##### Solutions for fire detection
- Temeprature sensors
- Smoke detectos
- Incipient detectors

#### Flooding
Prevent data centers from flooding
##### Solutions
- Choose a location not affected by floods
- Route the water path
- Moisture sensors

#### Electromagnetic interference
Generated by all electronic equipment

- Interferes with normal operation of other equipment
- Enables eavesdropping attacks
##### Solution
- Faraday cages

# Physical security control types

#### Intended Effect Categories

- **Deterrent controls**: prevent an intruder from trying to access secure area (e.g. warning signs)
- **Preventive controls**: block an intruder from accessing secure area (e.g. biometric sensors)
- **Detective controls**: Alert security personnel to a potential or actual security violation

#### Mechanism of action Categories

- **Technical controls**: technology to deter, prevent, or detect security vioaltions
- **Administrative controls**: rely upon business processes to enhance physical security

--> **Compensating controls**: fill known gaps in security

# Physical access control

Creates a secure perimeter

- **Locks**
	Preset locks: use physical keys
	Cipher locks: require a correct combinations
	Biometric locks: physical characteristic of user
	Card reader locks: magnetic strip or prosimity access card
- **Man trap**
	Avoid tailgating by having two doors
- **Mantain access lists carefully**
- **Facility moitoring**
	Motion detection
	Noise detection
- **Video surveillance**
	Infrared technology
- **Fences**
- **Cages**
	Separate equipment
- **Bollards**
- **Proper lightning**
- **Signs**
- **Industrial camouflage**
- **Drones and UAVs**

# Visitor Management

Protection against intrusions
- **Logs**
- **Identification badges**
- **Cameras**

# Data and media sanitization

When you store the contents of a file in a hard drive, there is no special space on the disk that is set aside for different folders
The Operating System present the data to you in its original form by looking at the metadata:

| Metadata                               |
| -------------------------------------- |
| Name: My File                          |
| Module: May 12, 2022                   |
| Owner: Mike                            |
| Storage Locations (on the hard drive): |
When a file is removed it deletes the *inode* or *MFT* (el puntero que apunta a su lugar en el disco), but the raw contents of the disk (desorganized file) is still there:
- Someone can reassamble the contents of the file

#### Data sanitization programs
Overwrite the data stored on disk

**Cloud service providers must perform overwriting priot to disposal or reuse**
#### Cryptographic Erasure
Deletes decryption keys (*all copies*)

# Packet Capture Tools
Allow deep inspection of traffic
#### Packet Capture in the Cloud
Cloud providers must partition network traffic to prevent users from eavesdropping on each other
Cloud providers must retain the capability to observe all traffic themselves
Cloud customers must understand the limitations of their own packet captures

`Wireshark`

`tcpdump`:
`$ tcpdump -n -i eth0`
`$ tcpdump -n -i eth0 'tcp port 22'`

Wireshark and tcpdum use the same filter language since they are bolth built on the **libpcap** library

`tcpreplay`
Allows editing and replaying traffic
