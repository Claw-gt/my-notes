# Hardware security configuration

One of the first tasks performed y any computer is loading the operating system

>[!important] If the operating system isn't already loaded, the computer relies on the BIOS

#### Basic Input/Output System (BIOS)
Tests hardware and loads OS
- Simple OS that is loaded at the beginning
- BIOS is stored on firmware chips (hardware chip) instead of on disk

>[!warning] Protecting BIOS is crucial

BIOS was replaces by UEFI
##### UEFI Secure Boot
Validates firmware integrity

- **Checksum Verification**
	UEFI computes a checksum of the binary prior to loading it and verifies that it appears on a list of approved checksums
- **Signature Verification**
	UEFI verifies the digital signature on a binary and ensures it is from a legitimate source

>[!info] UEFI can be built on a specialized hardware chip: Trusted Platform Module

##### *Trusted Platform Module (TPM)*: 
Cryptographic chip used for device security

- Serves as the UEFI root of trust
- Protects encryption keys
- Verifies hypervisor integrity

# Hardware Security Modules (HSMs)
*Cryptography is slow üê¢*

Manage encryption keys and perform cryptographic operations
Reduces the likelihood of compromised keys

#### [[Hardware Security Modules (HSMs)|FIPS 140-2]] Security Levels

# Virtualization Security Configuration

- Secure the Hypervisor
	Monitor
	Updates
- Maintain separation between security zones
- Leverage virtualization platform management tools

# Electromagnetic Interference (EMI)

Electromagnetic waves, normally generated unintentionally, that cause disruption to nearby electronic equipment

EMPs ‚û° Extreme bursts of EMIs (e.g. nuclear attack)
