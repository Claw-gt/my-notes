#### Pivot
After exploiting a vulnerability in a system, attacker use that system as a base from which to target other systems on the same local network

#### Persistence
After exploiting a vulnerability in a system, attackers install tools on that system to allow future access--even if the initial vulnerability is corrected

--> *Clean up at the end of the attack*

# Bug Bounty
Open security programs

Bug Bounty programs allow you to harness the work of hackers for your own purposes
*e.g. hackerone*

- Vendors offer both **self-managed** and **fully-managed** bounty programs
