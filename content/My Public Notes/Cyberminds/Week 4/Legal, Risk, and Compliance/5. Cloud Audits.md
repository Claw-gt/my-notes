--> Cloud Service Providers conduct their OWN audits : **SOC reports**
#### Service Organization Control (SOC) Reports

##### SOC 1
Provides assurance required for customer financial audits
##### SOC 2
Provides detailed assurance of confidentiality, integrity, and availability controls
##### SOC 3
Provides high-level public reporting of confidentiality, integrity, and availability controls

#### Type I Report
Describe the controls that the service provider has in place and an opinion on the suitability of those controls
#### Type II Report
Includes the same information as a Type I report along with the results of control testing by the auditor
