# Risk Assesment

#### Threat
An external force jeopardizing security
##### Threat vector
Specific method that threats use to exploit a vulnerability
#### Vulnerability
A weakness in security controls
#### Risk
Combination of a vulnerability and a corresponding threat

>[!info] Cloud computing changes the way that we think about risks

--> Prioritizing risk by *likelihood* and *impact*
#### Likelihood
The probability that a risk will occur
#### Impact
The amount of expected damage

### Qualitative Risk Assessment

Impact vs Probability

| Probability/Impact | Low      | Medium   | High     |
| ------------------ | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| High               | *Medium* | **High** | **High** |
| Medium             | Low      | *Medium* | **High** |
| Low                | Low      | Low      | *Medium* |

### Quantitative Risk Assessment

##### Asset Value (AV)
The dollar value of an asset
- original cost
- depreciated cost
- replacement cost
##### Exposure Factor (EF)
Expected percentage of damage to an asset
##### Single-Loss Expectancy (SLE)
Expected dollar loss if a risk occurs one time

$AV * EF = SLE$
##### Annualized Rate of Occurrence (ARO)
Number of times a risk is expected to occur each year
##### Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE)
Expected dollar loss from  a risk in any given year

$SLE * ARO = ALE$

#### Mean Time to Failure (MTTF)
Average time a nonrepairable component will last
#### Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)
Average time gap between failures of a repairable component
#### Mean Time to Repair (MTTR)
Average time required to return a repairable component to a service
