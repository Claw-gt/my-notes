# Web Application Firewalls
*a.k.a WAFs*
Screens web connections. They inspect HTTP requests made to a web server and watch for any signs of a potential attack occurring against the application itself

**Protects against:**
- SQL Injection
- Cross-site scripting
- Directory traversal
- Buffer overflows
- Privilege escalation
- Cookie-based attacks

##### Hardware WAF
Physical device positioned between the network firewall and web server
##### Software WAF
Software running on the web server that screens requests
##### Cloud-Based WAF
Third-party service that remotely filters malicious traffic
--> Effective againsta DDoS attacks
##### XML Firewall
Filters access to REST APIs

# Database security controls

#### Deidentification
