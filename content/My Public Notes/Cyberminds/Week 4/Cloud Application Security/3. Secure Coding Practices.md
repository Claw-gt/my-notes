# Secure coding guidance

OWASP produces the **Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS)**
**SAFECode** provides a forum for industry collaboration around software security

# Input Validation

User-supplied input creates security exposures

--> Input Validation filters user-supplied input
#### Whitelisting
^919df3
Specifies allowable input
👍More powerful
👎Not always practical

#### Blacklisting
^61278e
Specifies disallowed input
👍More flexible
👎Less effective

>[!important] The Input Validation should always be performed on the server, not within the browser
>The user controls the web browser

# Parameterized queries

The SQL template is precompiled on the database server
#### Stored Procedures
^91da62
Is precompiled. The underlying SQL statement cannot be modified 

# Authentication and session management issues

--> Never store passwords in plaintext form

### Protection of stored passwords
#### Hashing
Transform the password into a unique value that can't be reversed
#### Salting
Adds a random  value to passwords prior to hashing to protect against rainbow table attacks

### Encryption of passwords in transit
#### Transport Layer Security
Encrypts web traffic
TLS also protects HTTP headers, which includes session cookies

# Output Encoding

Replaces dangerous characters

#### HTML Encoding
Uses "&" notation to replace dangerous values that appear in an HTML-based web document
#### URL Encoding
Uses "%" notation to replace dangerous values that appear in a URL


| Original value | HTML Encoding | URL Encoding |
| -------------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| <              | \&lt;         | %3c          |
| >              | \&gt;         | %3e          |
| '              | \&\#x27       | %27          |
| "              | \&quot        | %28          |
| /              | \&\#x2f       | %2f          |
| &              | \&amp         | %26          |
| %              | \&\#x25       | %25          |

> [!important] Do not do manual encoding, use trusted libraries to perform output encoding

# Error and Exception Handling

>[!warning] Unpredictable states jeopardize application security

#### Javas's Try Catch Model

# Code Signing

Provides users with confidence that software comes from a trusted source
--> Digital signatures provide nonrepudiation

##### Verifying Code Signatures
1. The user downloads the software
2. The operating system uses the certificate's public key to validate signature
3. The OS verifies that the signature's hash matches the code
4. The OS verifies that the developer is trusted

# Database security

#### Database Normal Forms
Design rules for columns and tables

##### Why Normalize?
- Prevent data inconsistency
- Prevent update anomalies
- Reduce the need for restructuring existing databases
- Make the database schema more informative

**First Normal Form (1NF)**
1. Create separate tables for different sets of related data
2. Provide a primary key for every table
3. Records may not have multivalued fields
4. Records in a table must have the same number of fields

**Second Normal Form (2NF)**
1. The table must be in 1NF
2. Every non-key field must be a fact about the *entire* key

**Third Normal Form (3NF)**
1. The table must be in 2NF
2. No non-key field may be a fact about another non-key field

#### Encryption to portect sensitive data stored in a database

#### Obfuscation and camouflage hide the locations of sensitive information

#### Database Activity Monitoring
Logs and analyses database requests
#### Stored Procedures
