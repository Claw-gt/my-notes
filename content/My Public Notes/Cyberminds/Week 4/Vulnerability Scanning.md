### SCAP Components

- *Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)*

	Scores on a 10-point scale
	**Attack Vector (AV) :**
	
| Rating               | Description                                    |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Physical (P)         | Physical touch/manipulation is required        |
| Local (L)            | Physical or logical console access is required |
| Adjacent Network (A) | Local network access is required               |
| Network (N)          | Remotely exploitable vulnerability             |
	**Attack Complexity (AC) :**
	
| Rating   | Description                             |
| -------- | --------------------------------------- |
| High (H) | Requires specialized conditions         |
| Low (L)  | Does not require specialized conditions |
| None (N) | Requires no prior privileges            |
	**User Interaction (UI) :**

| Rating       | Description                           |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Required (R) | Requires that a user take some action |
| None (N)     | Does not require user interaction     |
$AV + AC + PR + UI = Exploitability$ of a vulnerability
-
	**Confidentiality** **(C)**

| Rating   | Description                            |
| -------- | -------------------------------------- |
| None (N) | No confidentiality impact              |
| Low (L)  | Access to some information is possible |
| High (H) | All information is compromised         |
	**Integrity (I)**
	
| Rating   | Description                                  |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| None (N) | No integrity impact                          |
| Low (L)  | Modification of some information is possible |
| High (H) | All information is compromised               |
	**Availability (A)**

| Rating   | Description             |
| -------- | ----------------------- |
| None (N) | No availability impact  |
| Low (L)  | Performance is degraded |
| High (H) | The system is shut down |
$C + I + A = Impact$ of a vulnerability
-
	**Scope (S)**

| Rating        | Description                                                                                |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Changed (C)   | Exploiting the vulnerability can affect other components                                   |
| Unchanged (U) | Exploiting the vulnerability only affects resources managed by the same security authority |
