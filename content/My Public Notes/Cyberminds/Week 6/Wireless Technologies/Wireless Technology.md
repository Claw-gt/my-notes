Radio signals spread out like ripples in a lake
**Inverse square law:** Double the distnace --> Four times the power required (free space loss)
RAdio signals can be blocked, attenuated or reflected by objects in the propagation path, leading to additional losses

### Frequency

Frequency affects available bandwisth and data rate
Higher frequencies offer larger bandwidth and the transmission of more data in a given time
However, higher frequencies are more prone to attenuation over distance/obstacles compared to lower frequencies

### Throughput
not the same as data rate
*Note: data rate is the theoretical maximum speed at which data can be transmitted*
Throughput is the *actual* speed of data transfer

Data rate increases, the range for effective communication shrinks
Fast data rates requirea high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for successful demodulation

### Noise
The signal-to-noise ratio compares signal power levels to noise power levels
Various sources contribute to radio noise, including cosmic background radiation, solar interference, lightning, power lines, motors, and unrelated radio communications

### Antennas
Boundary between the wire and the air
The transmitter transmits through an antenna

The lower the frrequency, the bigger the required antenna size
Miniaturized antennas are possible, but come with a penalty in gain and bandwidth
Antenna performance is very sensitive to their immediate environment
Antennas vary directivity (e.g. **omni** vs. **directional** antennas), gain, bandwidth, etc.
