## Cyber Defense Spectrum

**Vulnerability Scanning** (such as Nessus) + **Pen Testing** (such as zero-day vulnerabilities) + **Red Teaming** + **Cyber Hunter** (search for indicators of compromise)

## Cyber Kill Chain

- **Reconnaissance** (IP address, port scan, identify vectos for attacks, checking software versions)
- **Weaponization** (Customize a vulnerability to a target)
- **Delivery** (Email attachment, compromised website, log in to the target, flash drive, internet-exposed vulnerability)
- **Exploitation** (exploit a vulnerability, unauthrized use of credentials, unaware execution of malware)
- **Installation** (install payload into memory or disk, execute payload after system restart, provides ongoing access)
- **Command and Control** (connect to the commands and control server, receive commands, determine the command)
- **Action**
