## Types of access control

##### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Access decisions are based on the roles assigned to users within an organization
##### Discretionary Access Control (DAC)
Based on the identity of users and/or membership in certain groups. Information owner has discretion to change access rights at any time
##### Mandatory Access Control (MAC)
Access is based on fized policies set by a central authority. MAC secures information by assigning sensitivity labels on information and comparing this to the level of sensitivity a user is operating at
##### Permission-Based Access Control 
Access is granted based on specific permissions assigned to users for particular actions. The abstraction of application actions into a set of permissions

1. **Authorization and Authentication are different concepts**: 
- Authentication is about verifying the identity of a user or entity. 
- Authorization is about granting or denying access to specific resources based on the user's permissions.
    
2. **Broken Access Control is a major security risk**: 
- It is the #1 security risk in the OWASP Top 10 2021.
- It has a very high prevalence, with almost 95% of applications having at least one related vulnerability.
- There are over 19,000 known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) associated with broken access control.
    
3. **Common Access Control Vulnerabilities**: 
- Bypassing access control checks by modifying URLs, HTML, or using custom tools.
- Elevation of privilege by acting as a user without being logged in or as an admin when logged in as a user.
- Metadata manipulation, such as tampering with JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), access control cookies, or hidden fields.
- CORS misconfigurations that allow unauthorized cross-origin access.
- Forcibly browsing to authenticated or privileged pages as an unauthenticated or lower-privileged user.
    
4. **Best Practices for Secure Access Control**: 
- Deny access by default and only grant access to authorized users.
- Implement access control mechanisms once and reuse them throughout the application.
- Enforce record ownership and limit CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations. 
- Disable web server directory listings and remove file metadata backups.
- Log access control failures, rate-limit API and controller access, and invalidate JWTs on logout.
- Incorporate access control testing into the development and QA processes..
    
5. **Resources**:
- OWASP resources like the Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) and access control cheat sheets can help guide secure access control implementation.
    

>[!info] Summary
>Broken access control is a pervasive and high-impact security risk that requires careful design, implementation, and testing of access control mechanisms to protect applications and data from unauthorized access.
