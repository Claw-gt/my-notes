1. **Shift Left and Beyond**:
    - Insecure design focuses on the fundamental architectural and design decisions made before any code is written.
    - It emphasizes the need to move the security discussion even further "left" in the development lifecycle, into the pre-code activities.
2. **Secure by Design Principles**:
    - Secure design is a culture, methodology, and mindset, not just an add-on or tool.
    - It requires integrating threat modeling, secure design patterns, and secure development practices from the very beginning.
3. **Importance of Threat Modeling**:
    - Threat modeling should be a continuous process, integrated into refinement sessions, user story development, and analyzing assumptions.
    - The goal is to identify and address design flaws that could lead to vulnerabilities, not just focus on implementation defects.
4. **Secure Development Life Cycle**:
    - Secure software development requires a structured, methodical approach, not just writing code.
    - Engaging security specialists from the start and using frameworks like the OWASP SAMM can help establish a secure SDLC.
5. **Factors Highlighting Insecure Design Risks**:
    - 40 CWEs were mapped to insecure design, with over 260,000 instances found in the tested applications.
    - The average weighted exploit score was 6.46 and the average weighted impact was 6.78, indicating significant risk.
6. **Design Flaw Examples**:
    - Insecure password recovery mechanisms (e.g., using knowledge-based questions/answers)
    - Allowing unlimited ticket reservations without deposits, leading to denial of service
7. **Protecting Against Insecure Design**:
    - Establish a secure development life cycle and a library of secure design patterns.
    - Integrate threat modeling, security controls, and plausibility checks into the design and development process.
    - Segregate application layers based on exposure and protection needs, and limit resource consumption.

> [!info] Summary
> The key message is that insecure design is a fundamental issue that requires a shift in mindset and practices, moving security considerations earlier in the development lifecycle and focusing on secure architecture and design, not just secure implementation.
