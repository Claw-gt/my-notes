1. **Software and Data Integrity Failures as a New Risk**:
    - This is a new category in the OWASP Top 10 2021, highlighting the importance of ensuring the integrity of software and data used by applications.
2. **Risks of Relying on Untrusted Software Components**:
    - Applications that use plugins, libraries, or modules from untrusted sources can introduce vulnerabilities and allow for unauthorized access or malicious code injection.
3. **Insecure CI/CD Pipelines**:
    - Weaknesses in the continuous integration and deployment processes can lead to the introduction of unauthorized changes or malicious code into the application.
4. **Importance of Verifying Software Updates**:
    - Automatic software update functionality can be abused by attackers if the integrity of the updates is not properly verified.
5. **High Business Impact**:
    - Software and data integrity failures have one of the highest average weighted impact scores (7.94 out of 10) among the OWASP Top 10 risks.
6. **Protecting Against Integrity Failures**:
    - Use digital signatures or similar mechanisms to verify the source and integrity of software and data.
    - Consume libraries and dependencies from trusted repositories, and use tools like OWASP Dependency Check or OWASP CycloneDX to identify vulnerabilities.
    - Implement robust review processes and segregation of duties in the CI/CD pipeline.
    - Ensure unsigned or unencrypted serialized data is not sent to untrusted clients without integrity checks.
7. **High-Profile Attacks Exploiting Integrity Failures**:
    - The SolarWinds supply chain attack, where malware was injected into software updates, highlights the real-world impact of these vulnerabilities.

>[!info] Summary
>The key message is that ensuring the integrity of software and data is critical to protecting applications from unauthorized modifications, malicious code injection, and other attacks that can have severe consequences for organizations.
