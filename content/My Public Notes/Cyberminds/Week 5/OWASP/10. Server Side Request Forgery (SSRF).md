1. **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) as a New Top 10 Risk**:
    - SSRF is a new entry in the OWASP Top 10 2021, ranking at #10.
    - It was added based on community survey feedback, indicating it is a significant concern despite a relatively low incidence rate.
2. **Factors Highlighting SSRF Risks**:
    - Only 1 CWE was mapped to this risk, but it had a high average weighted exploit score of 8.28 and impact score of 6.72.
    - Over 9,500 out of 500,000 tested applications were found vulnerable, with 385 associated CVEs.
3. **Understanding SSRF**:
    - SSRF occurs when a web application fetches a remote resource without properly validating the user-supplied URL.
    - This allows attackers to coerce the application to send requests to unexpected, potentially sensitive destinations, *even when protected by a firewall, VPN or another type of network ACL*.
4. **SSRF Attack Scenarios**:
    - Redirecting the server-side request to access internal-only services or arbitrary external systems.
    - Exploiting open redirects in backend APIs to access sensitive internal resources.
5. **Protecting Against SSRF**:
    - Implement network-level controls, such as segmenting remote resource access, enforcing firewall policies, and logging network flows.
    - Sanitize and validate all client-supplied input data, and enforce URL schema, port, and destination with allow lists.
    - Disable HTTP redirections where possible, and avoid trying to mitigate SSRF with deny lists.
6. **Importance of Comprehensive Vulnerability Awareness**:
    - SSRF represents a specific vulnerability type, whereas some other Top 10 risks encompass broader categories of weaknesses.
    - The OWASP Top 10 aims to raise awareness of emerging threats, even if the incidence rate is relatively low.

>[!info] Summary
>The key message is that Server-Side Request Forgery, while a more specialized vulnerability, can have severe consequences if left unaddressed, and organizations need to implement robust defense-in-depth strategies to protect against this risk.
