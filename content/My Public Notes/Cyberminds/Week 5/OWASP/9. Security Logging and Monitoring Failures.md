1. **Importance of Security Logging and Monitoring**:
    - This risk, while not as data-rich as some others, was elevated to #9 on the OWASP Top 10 2021 based on feedback from the security community.
    - Detecting and responding to security breaches is critical, but this area is challenging to test and measure.
2. **Impact of Data Breaches**:
    - The average cost of a data breach in 2021 was $4.24 million, a 10% increase from 2019.
    - Healthcare organizations had the highest average cost of data breaches, highlighting the need for robust logging and monitoring in sensitive sectors.
    - Remote work was a significant factor, increasing breach costs by an average of $1.07 million.
3. **Lack of Logging and Monitoring as a Vulnerability**:
    - If an organization is not logging security events or monitoring those logs, they are likely vulnerable to this risk.
    - Indicators include lack of logging for failed logins, warnings, errors, and suspicious activities.
    - Failure to monitor logs, store them securely, and set appropriate alerting thresholds can all contribute to this vulnerability.
4. **Protecting Against Logging and Monitoring Failures**:
    - Ensure all relevant security events are logged with sufficient context and retained for forensic analysis.
    - Adopt centralized log management solutions that can consume and analyze the logs.
    - Implement integrity controls to prevent tampering of audit trails.
    - Establish effective monitoring and alerting to detect and respond to suspicious activities.
5. **Incident Response Planning**:
    - Develop a comprehensive incident response and recovery plan, with clear roles, responsibilities, and approval processes.
    - Regularly train and exercise the incident response plan to identify areas for improvement.
    - Ensure communication and feedback loops with executive management to address root causes.

>[!info] Summary
>The key message is that effective security logging and monitoring, coupled with a robust incident response plan, are critical to detecting, responding to, and preventing security breaches, which can have severe financial and reputational consequences for organizations.
