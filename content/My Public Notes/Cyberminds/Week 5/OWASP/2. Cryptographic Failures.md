# Cryptographic Failures

1. **Importance of Cryptography**:
    
    - Cryptography is essential for secure communication and data protection on the internet.
    - Most major websites and applications today use encryption, with around 95% of Google's sites using HTTPS.
2. **Cryptographic Failures as a Security Risk**:
    
    - Cryptographic failures are a significant security risk, ranked #2 in the OWASP Top 10 2021.
    - Over 233,000 out of 500,000 applications tested had some form of cryptographic failure, with over 3,000 known vulnerabilities.
3. **Cryptography Basics**:
    
    - The TLS handshake process involves the client and server negotiating the cipher suite to use for secure communication.
    
    _If there is no match between cipher suites, the connection is not established._
    
    _The web server gets to decide which cipher suite to use._
    
    _The user and the browser calculate individually what assymetric key are going to use by exchanging some minimal information_
    
    - Symmetric encryption is used for the bulk of the encrypted traffic, with the key exchange process establishing the shared symmetric key.
4. **Examples of Cryptographic Failures**:
    
    - Automatically decrypting sensitive data (e.g., credit card numbers) after retrieval from a database (allows a successful SQL injection).
    - Allowing unencrypted pages or weak encryption protocols within a web application (TLS 1.0 or SSL).
5. **Factors Indicating Vulnerability**:
    
    - Determining the protection needs of data (in transit and at rest).
    - Identifying the use of old or weak cryptographic algorithms, protocols, and keys.
    - Ensuring encryption is properly enforced and that certificates are properly validated.
6. **Protecting Against Cryptographic Failures**:
    
    - Classifying and protecting sensitive data.
    - Encrypting all sensitive data, both in transit and at rest.
    - Using up-to-date, strong cryptographic algorithms, protocols, and key management.
    - Enforcing encryption using security directives like HSTS.
    - Disabling caching for responses containing sensitive data.

>[!info] Summary
>The key message is that cryptographic failures can have severe consequences, and organizations need to carefully design, implement, and maintain their cryptographic controls to protect against this significant security risk.
