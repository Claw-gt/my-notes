>[!Definition] Vulnerability
>"A weakness in the computational logic (e.g. code) found in software and hardware components that, when, exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Mitigation of the vulnerabilities in this context typically involves coding changes, but could also include specification changes or even specification deprecations"

1. **Understanding Vulnerabilities**:
    - Vulnerabilities are weaknesses in software or hardware that can be exploited, leading to negative impacts on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
    - Exploits are the specific actions taken by attackers to take advantage of vulnerabilities.
2. **Factors Highlighting Vulnerable Components Risks**:
    - This security risk had a relatively low number of associated CWEs (3) and CVEs (0) compared to other risks.
    - However, it still had over 30,000 occurrences across the tested applications, with a high average weighted exploit score of 5.
3. **Widespread Use of Vulnerable Components**:
    - Web applications often rely on multiple components, libraries, frameworks, and databases, many of which may have known vulnerabilities.
    - Searching for vulnerabilities in common components like Java, .NET, Apache, and MySQL reveals a large number of associated CVEs.
4. **Understanding CVEs and NVD**:
    - The [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)](https://cve.mitre.org/) database provides detailed information on specific vulnerabilities, including the affected software versions and recommended mitigations.
    - The [National Vulnerability Database (NVD)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln) provides additional context, including CVSS severity scores, to help organizations assess the risk of vulnerabilities.
5. **Vulnerable Components Exploitation Scenarios**:
    - Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in components to gain remote code execution, leading to significant breaches.
    - Internet of Things (IoT) devices are particularly vulnerable due to the difficulty in patching them --> Mirai Botnet
    - *Shodan IOT search engine ("Struts") can help find devices that suffer from vulnerabilities*.
1. **Protecting Against Vulnerable Components**:
    - Establish a patch management process to keep components up-to-date and remove unused dependencies.
    - Continuously monitor for vulnerabilities, subscribe to security bulletins, and automate the process of identifying and addressing vulnerable components.
    - Only use components from official sources and be aware of unmaintained or unsupported software.
    - Ensure there is an ongoing plan for monitoring, triaging, and applying updates for the lifetime of the application.

>[!info] Summary
>The key message is that vulnerable and outdated components are a pervasive security risk, and organizations need to have robust processes and tools in place to identify, prioritize, and address these vulnerabilities in a timely manner to protect their applications and systems.
