--> âš  Do not trust algorithms that are not public
Security by obscurity is not the way

--> Key length
Some algorithms have a fixed key length

##### Cryptogtaphy relies on pseudorandom number generation
Computer cannot a truly random number
#### Confusion
Every bit of the ciphertext must depend upon more than one bit of the encryption key
#### Diffusion
Changing a single bit of the plaintext should change about 50% of the ciphertext bits
#### Obsfuscation
Uses cryptography to hide source code from users
