Depend on **pseudorandom numbers**

#### Confusion
Every bit of the ciphertext must depend upon more than one bit of the encryption key

#### Diffusion
Changing a single bit of the plaintext should change about 50% of the ciphertext bits

#### Obfuscation
Uses cryptography to hide source code from users
