# Transport Layer Security

TLS uses digital certificates to **encrypt network communications**
- Protocol that uses other encryption algorithms --> it depends upon pairings of encryption and hash functions known as **cipher suites**
- The security of TLS will depend on the cipher-suites
- Communication between web-browsers and web-servers 
- *Session keys* = *Ephemeral keys*
