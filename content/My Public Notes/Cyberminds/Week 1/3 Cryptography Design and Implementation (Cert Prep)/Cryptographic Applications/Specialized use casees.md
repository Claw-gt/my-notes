Specialized cryptographic hardware allows operations at low-power levels
Networked cryptography requires very low latency
High resiliency requires the protection of encrypted data against loss

#### Homomorphic Encryption

Encryption algorithms to create ciphertext outputs which allow computations that generate an encrypted result which, when decrypted, matches the results of computation on the plaintext
