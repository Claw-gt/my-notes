- Some algorithms are faster than other
Symmetric > Asymmetric
Longer keys --> More secure but more more power consumption
- Some key choices may have inherent flaws
- Reusing the same key
- Cryptographic algorithms and keys have limited longevity
- Entropy reduces the predictability of cryptographic methods
- Downgrade attacks remove or weaken encryption
