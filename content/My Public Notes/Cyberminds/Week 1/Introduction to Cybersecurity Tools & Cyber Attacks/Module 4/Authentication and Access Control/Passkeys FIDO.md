#### Device Lost?

--> **Account Recovery**
*same as if you lose your password*

#### Multiple Devices?

--> **Synchronize**
*Share private key in the cloud*

#### SSH? PGP?

--> SSH transmits the keys through an encrypted channel providing confidentiality
--> FIDO does NOT send the private key, only the passkey (OTP). There is no information exchange

#### Password Problems?

- People
--> Requirements: **Complex**, **unique** and **fresh**

#### Password Manager?

Great but...
**Does not protect from phising**: 
- Does not check websites
- Password databases inside webpages (can be cracked)

FIDO protects from these since it does not send the **secret**, it stays on the device
