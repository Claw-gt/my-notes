### Application vulnerability scanners
This test must be passed before deploying:

**Evaluate in-house developed software**
**Static application security testing (SAST)**
- Inspects the source code
- Provides targeted advice
**Dynamic application security testing (DAST)**
- Executes code during the evaluation
- Probes all the user-facing interfaces with varied inputs
**Interactive application security testing (IAST)**
- Dynamic + Static principles
- Examines application's code in real-time
