Safeguards networks form unauthorized access
Establishes secure insfrastructure

Multilayered approach -> **Defense in depth**

##### Objectives

ðŸš«Block unauthorized entities
Identify and stop cyber threats
Ensure secure access for legitimate users

##### Mechanisms

**External Boundary**

- Implements security measures
- Prevents infiltration

**Internal safeguards**

- Protect critical components
- Act as a secondary defense

##### Tools and Techniques

**Firewall**
- Hardware or software barriers
- Filter malicious data traffic

-> *Basic Firewall*
- Scrutinize traffic through packet filtering
- Verify source and destination
->*Innovative Firewall*
- Intrusion Prevention Systems
- Leverage AI and ML
- Monitor apps
- Use threat intelligence

**Network Access Control (NAC)**

Vigilant gatekeeper
Manages user authentication and authorization
Performs risk assessments
Avert risks posed by vulnerable devices

*NAC: Authentication*
- Verifies user identity
- Grants access permissions

**Intrusion detection and prevention system (IDPS)**

Situated beyond the firewall
Scrutinizes network traffic
Identifies and manages threats

-> *Traditional IDPS*
- Detects and signals unusual activities
-> *Modern IDPS*
- Reacts to perceived threats
- Halts suspicious traffic
- Terminates connections

**Virtual Private Network (VPN)**

Conceals online identity
Encrypts internet traffic
Obscures IP address
Masks geographical location

**Network segmentation**

Partitions a network
Limits lateral movement
Unique policies and access controls
Isolation of critical systems


**Security information and event management (SIEM)**

 Enhances network security
 Aggregates and analyzes logs (Servers, Endpoints, and Network devices)

-> Enables real-time visibility
-> Identify abnormal activity
*Advances SIEMs*
-> Leverage ML and AI
-> Automate threat identification
-> Identify malicious patterns

**Security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR)**

Works with SIEM systems
Streamlines security operations
Integrates security tools
Automates workflows
-> Reduces response time
-> Empowers alert management
-> reduces alert fatigue
##### Endpoint security

**Endpoints:**
- Computers
- Mobile devices
- Servers

**Endpoint security**
- Secures endpoints for network protection
- Vital since can be the entry point for attackers

-> *Antivirus*
-> *Anti-malware*
-> *Firewalls*

For **detection, preventions threats and response to them** and **monitor and manage access**
