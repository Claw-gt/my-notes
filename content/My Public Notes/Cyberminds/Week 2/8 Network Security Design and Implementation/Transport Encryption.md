# TLS

Depends upon pairings of encryption and hash functions known as cipher suites.
âš  Not cryptographic algorithm by itself

Server --3.Digital Certificate --> Cliente
Cliente --4.Valid? --> CA
CA --5.Yes --> Cliente
Cliente --6.Session Key --> Server
```

Seesion key (*ephemeral keys*) is encrypted by the client using the server's public key

> [!important] SSL
> Insecure TLS predecessor 

**OpenSSL** --> open-source TLS
- Heartbleed Bug

# IPsec

**Internet Protocl**

Secure the entire packet payload

#### Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)
Confidentiality and Integrity protection for packet payload

#### Authentication Header (AH)
Provides integrity protection for packet headers and payloads

**ESP + AH** --> Confidentiality + Integrity

### Security Association (SA)
Identifies cryptographic algorithms that IPsec can support

### USES

#### Site-to-Site VPNs
Encrypted tunnels connecting two network together in a manner that is transparent to users
--> IPsec tunnel: **Tunnel mode**
#### End-User VPNs
Provide encrypted remote network access for individual systems
--> IPsec: **Transport Mode**

# Securing common protocols

#### Web page protocols HTTP -- HTTPS
HTTPS adds TLS to web browsing

| Protocol | Port |
| -------- | ---- |
| HTTP     | 80   |
| HTTPS    | 443  |
#### Remote access protocols: Telnet -- SSH
Telnet uses CLI access
SSH is a secure alternative


| Protocol | Port | Description                                                                |
| -------- | ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Telnet   | 23   | Remotely control a devices, console, or command shell, not encrypted       |
| SSH      | 22   | Romotely control a device securely via console or command shell, encrypted |
| RDP      | 3389 | Remotely control a computer via GUI                                        |

#### File transfer Protocols: FTP -- FTPS or SFTP or SCP
FTP is insecure
TFTP is also insecure
FTPS adds TLS to FTP
SFTP tranfers files over SSH
Secure Copy (SCP) provides secure command-line transfer over SSH

| Protocol | Port | Description                   |
| -------- | ---- | ----------------------------- |
| FTP      | 21   | File transfers, not encrypted |
| SFTP     | 22   | File transfers, encrypted     |
#### Voice and video -- TLS
RTP-based VoIP services should use **Secure RTP**

#### Network Time Protocol (NTP) -- NTPSec
Synchronizes system clocks

#### Email Protocols

| Protocol | Unencrypted Port | Encrypted Port | Description                      |
| -------- | ---------------- | -------------- | -------------------------------- |
| POP      | 110              | 995            | Receiving and downloading emails |
| IMAP     | 143              | 993            | Receiving emails                 |
| SMTP     | 25               | 465            | Sending and receiving emails     |

#### Encrypt email messages and attachments: S/MIME

#### Secure Networking Protocols
- Use DNSSEC to add digital signatures to DNS
- Limit authorized DHCP servers
- LDAPS offers a secure alternative to LDAP


| Protocol | Port    | Description                                                          |
| -------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| DHCP     | 67, 68  | Automatically assign IP addresses                                    |
| DNS      | 53      | Resolves or translates domain names to IP addresses                  |
| SMB      | 137-139 | Enables file and printer sharing on a network                        |
| SNMP     | 161     | Monitors the network                                                 |
| LDAP     | 389     | Stores, authenticates, and shares passwords, usernames, and accounts |
