# Mobile device security

4-digit passcodes do not provide adequeate security
### Use complex alphanumeric passcode

### Biometric authentication

### Full-Device Encyrption
Protect sensitive encryption
### Remote wiping

### Lock mobile devices automatically
### MFA
### MicroSD HSMs
Provide secure encryption key management

### Security-Enhanced Linux in Andrid (SELinux)

---
# Mobile Device Management (MDM)
Manage setting across many sevices
--> Integrated into Unified Endopoint Managemetn (UEM) solutions
e.g. Google Mobile Management

# Mobile Device Tracking

### Asset Tracking Software
Manages device inventories
Must cover entire Lifecycle

### Geolocation

### Geofencing
Alerts when a device leaves a defined area

--> GPS Use Limits

---
# Mobile application security

### Authentication
Use strong credential management
Rely upon central authentication
--> Using external authentication places great trust in external providers

### Encrypt Sensitive Information
Encrypt info in transit and in rest
Practice strong key management

### Geotagging
May disclose sensitive locations
Security and privacy concerns

---
# Mobile security enforcement

MDM solutions to enforce company's security polcies

### Sideloading
--> Third-party app stores may contain unsafe code
--> Problem on Andorid devices since they use an open app model
--> Apple devices restrict users to official App Store

### Jailbreaking
Circumvent authentication and load an old, securityless firmware

--> OTA updates

# Bring your own device (BYOD)

### BYOD Onboarding
Ensure the device meets security requirements and is safely configured

### BYOD Offboarding
Remove all corporate information from the personally owned device

---

# Mobile Deployment Models

BYOD strategies limit corporate control of devices
MDM provides a policy enforcement mechanism
### Choose Your Own Device (COYD)
User select devices

### Company Owned, Personally Enabled (COPE)
Allows personal use of corporate devices

### Virtual Desktop Infrastructure
