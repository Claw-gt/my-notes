Connectivity building blocks of a network
# Switches

Connect devices to the network
Ethernet jacks are at the other end of network cables connected to switches

**Wireless access point (WAPs)** connect to switches and create Wi-Fi networks

Switches are limited to creating *local networks*
- They operate on **Data Link Layer** --> work with MAC addresses
- They may function at **Network Layer** --> interpret IP addresses --> work as routers

# Routers

Connect networks to each other, making intelligent packet routing decisions
They have **Access Control Lists (ACLs)** to limit the traffic that may or leave the network --> **Stateless inspection**

# Bridges

Connect networks using simple forwarding
They learn both MAC addresses and forward traffic
