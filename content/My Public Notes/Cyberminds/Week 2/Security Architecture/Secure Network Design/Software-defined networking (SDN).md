Treats network functionality and implementation details separately
Reconfiguring traditional networks requires reconfiguring devices

--> Software-defined networking (SDN) separates **control plane** from the **data plane**
--> SDN makes the network programmable
## Control Plane
Responsible for making routing and switching decisions
--> SDN controller
## Data Plane
Responisble for carryig out the instructions of the control plane
--> Routers and Switches accepts instructions from Control Plane

**SDN Security Benefits**
- Allows granular network configuration
- Facilitates faster response to security incidents

**SDN increases network complexity** --> requires strict access control

## SD-WAN
Extends the benefits of SDN to wide-are networks connecting remote sites
--> Vulnerabilities: a security breach on one site could expose other sites to security risks
