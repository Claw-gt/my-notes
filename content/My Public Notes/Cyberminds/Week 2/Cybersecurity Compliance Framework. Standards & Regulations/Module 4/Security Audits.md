 Comprehensive review of security architecture
 Identifies vulnerabilities
 Ensures compliance
 Thorough inspection of digital infrastructure

### Process

#### 1. Scope Definitions

##### Security Rules Examination
--> Review security policies and procedures (e.g. Access controls, IR...)
##### Legal Requirements Review
--> Compliance with laws and regulations (e.g. GDPR, HIPAA...)
##### Business needs analysis
--> Evaluate specific needs and goals
--> Identify critical assets
--> Consider risk tolerance and align audit focus

#### 2. Information collection

##### System configurations
--> Examine HW and SW config
--> Evaluate systems, servers, firewalls, and applications

##### Network diagrams
--> Provide visual representations of the network (router, switches, firewalls, and connections)
--> Help understand data flow
--> Identify security weaknesses

##### Access control mechanisms
--> Manage access to resources

##### Policy documentation
--> e.g. Security policies, procedures, and guidelines
--> Covers, IR plans, data protection policies, and security training materials
--> Verify procedures

#### 3. Threats and vulnerabilities identifications

##### Vulnerability scans
--> Use automated tools to check systems
--> Scan against a database of vulnerabilities
--> Generate reports
##### Penetration testing
--> Perform simulated attacks on the system
--> Done by ethical hackers
--> Exploit vulnerabilities in the system's defense

##### System configuration reviews
--> Review hardware and software setups
--> Find misconfiguration issues

#### 4. Risk Analysis

##### Likelihood of threat exploitations
--> Assess the probability of threat exploiting vulnerabilities

##### Impact on organization
--> Analyze consequences of a successful exploit
--> Evaluate the sensitivity of risk data
--> Financial implications of breach

#### 5. Policy and procedure examination

##### Access Management
--> Ensure authorized individuals have access (e.g. MFA, RBAC, and the Principle of Least Privilege)
##### Data safeguarding
--> Evaluate data safeguarding policies and practices (e.g. Encryption, data masking, DLP, backups...)
--> Maintain confidentiality and integrity
##### Incident response
--> Ensure procedures are comprehensive and effective
--> Assess preparedness to handle security breaches
--> Process for containing incidents

#### 6. Document findings
--> Record audit process and detail:
- Scope
- Identified threats and vulnerabilities
- Risk assessments

#### 7. Improvement recommendations

#### 8. Follow-up implementation
