> Security compliance **ensures necessary standards and regulations are met**, **influenced by external factors**

#### Regulatory requirements
e.g. GPDR
#### Legal considerations
e.g. discrimination laws

#### Industry considerations
e.g. Healthcare organizations must adhere to HIPAA

#### Local and regional considerations
e.g. culture, local customs and regulations

#### National considerations
e.g. tax laws

#### Global considerations
e.g. robust security measures for supply chain complexities

### Consequences of non-compliance

--> Fines
--> Sanctions
--> Reputational damage
--> ⚠ Loss of license
--> ⚠ Contractual impacts

### Due diligence

- Investigate and validate security posture and threats
- Analyze security landscape
- Assess vulnerabilities
- Ensure protective measures are updated

### Attestation and Acknowledgment

#### Attestation

- Witness and verify authenticity
- Confirms functioning of security controls
#### Acknowledgment

- Recognize and admit truth or existence
- Accept and address security breaches

### Internal and external monitoring

#### Internal monitoring

- In-house audits
- Training
- Reviews
- Ensure compliance with legal and regulatory requirements

#### External monitoring

- Conducted by third parties
- Provide unbiased evaluations
- Identifies improvement areas

### Automation

- Technology to perform tasks
- Streamlines security operations and enhances efficiency

# Automation and Orchestration

### Automation
Performing tasks with minimal human intervention
### Orchestration
Coordinating automated tasks and workflows across various systems and services
Automation of individual tasks

## In Cybersecurity
e.g.
- **User provisioning**
	Resource provisioning
	Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
	Security groups
	Ticket creation
	Escalation
	Enabling/disabling services and access
	Continous integration and testing
	Integrations and APIs

# Change Management

- Helps adapt to new technologies and regulations
- Guides through transitions and transformations
- Rolls out strategies to manage change smoothly
- Gets everyone on board with new methods or resources

### Change Management Policies
Procedures for:
- Reviewing, approving and executing proposed modifications
-  Balancing sybersecuirty threats

### Change Management Plan

Areas of focus:

**Ownership**
- Define the responisibility for each aspect
- Helps with accountability and validation
**Stakeholders**
- People or groups interested in changes made to security operations
- Keep them informed and involved
**Test results**
- Test changes before full implementation
- Outline the types of tests and how results will be measured
**Backout plan**
- To reverse changes
- Ensures security operations can return to a known good state
**Maintenance window**
- Schedules changes during off-peak hours
- Minimizes user impact
- Reduces risk of exposing vulnerabilities

Disposal and decommissioning:

- **Data security**
	Physical destruction: render devices unusable
	Degaussing: erase the magnetic media by applying a powerful magnetic field
	Incineration: melt down electronics, ensuring no data recovery
	Chemical destruction: dissolve memory chips and other data storage components by chemical processes
	Electromagnetic destruction: by electromagnetic pulses, you can permanently erase data on electronic devices
